# Special ScreenKit Styles

Not all ScreenKit elements can be easily inherited via the style prefix. To accommodate for this, ScreenKit also includes some special styles that must be applied to an interface element specifically.

## Text Buttons

The following styles apply to text buttons (`textbutton`). These styles can also be used as a style prefix when in a `hbox` or a `vbox`.

### `ASInterfacePushButton`
The base style for a push button.

### `ASInterfaceCheckbox`
The base style for a checkbox.

### `ASInterfaceRadio`
The base style for a radio button.

## Scrollable Content
The following styles apply to scrollable areas where a scrollbar is present.

### `ASInterfaceScrollbar`
The base style for a scrollable area.

- Used with `viewport`.
- Can be used as a style prefix.
